## User Story

As a Full Stack Web Developer I want to boost my visibility in order to increase my professional opportunities.

## About
This single-page web application was bootstrapped with a free template from Twitter Bootstrap. 

https://startbootstrap.com/themes/grayscale/

Prior to this project I had not encountered the linear-gradient property in CSS or done any work with smooth scrolling. Refactoring this open-source Bootstrap Template into a React application taught me more about those and other effects than I would have learned had I built the whole application from scratch.

## Technologies Used
- React
- CSS

- JavaScript
